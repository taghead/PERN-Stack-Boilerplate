# Scope and Planning
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

This application will involve communicating customer data over the backend and personilzing the user experience.  

## The Stack

- Node JS ES6+ Typescript/Javascript
- Next JS and React using Tailwind ( Styled Components? )
- Prisma ( PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server, and SQLite )

## Extras
- Storybook and JSDocs
- GraphQL
- Cypress for UI and E2E testing
- JEST for testing buisiness logic. [(Consider following OWASP guidlines)](https://kennel209.gitbooks.io/owasp-testing-guide-v4/content/en/web_application_security_testing/business_logic_testing.html)

## Priorities

Secure and safe ways of handling user data.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
